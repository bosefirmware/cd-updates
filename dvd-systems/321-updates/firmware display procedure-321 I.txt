Procedure to check the 321 Series I firmware level installed:

Press and hold the Volume +, Scan >>, and Eject all at the same time. 

If "BOSE 321" appears and then disappears on the display, you will need 
to unplug/re-plug in the bass module. 

After holding them for a least 7 seconds, release the three buttons at 
the same time. Note: Some lights on the display may be flickering before 
releasing the buttons. 
 
The display should then read "321 ???". The "???" 
being the software revision. 

Or if you have a later software already installed will show a 6 digit 
number like 010310 or the like.

The higher the number the newer the firmware level installed.
