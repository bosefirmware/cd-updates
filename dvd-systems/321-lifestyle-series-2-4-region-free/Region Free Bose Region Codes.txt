Turn the machine on and load a normal (region 2 if in UK) DVD. While the disc is 
playing:

1) Right arrow (Navigation Button)
2) Up arrow (Navigation/Tune Up Button)
3) Press Shuffle.
4) Press Stop.
5) Press Mute.

Make sure that there is a gap of at least 1 second between presses and ignore error 
messages on the TV screen. If successful, the disc drawer will part eject quickly 
twice (I only saw it do one cycle, but it was very quick). Using the remote control, 
switch the system off for at least one minute then turn it on. It should now be set 
to region 0 and most DVD's should play.

If you have problems with RCE (Region Code Enhanced) discs, having followed the above 
and with a disc playing:-

1) Press Stop.
2) Press Shuffle.
3) Press whatever number on the remote control corresponds with the region 
    number of the disc you are trying to play.
4) Press Enter.

With luck, your player should play the RCE disc ok but remember to go through the 
above sequence again and at 3), enter 0 to set it back to region free.

If it doesn't play the RCE disc, try pressing STOP twice (this may counter the RESUME 
function taking the disc back to the beginning 'world map'). If STOP is prohibited, 
try disconecting the media centre from the power supply, waiting 1 minute then 
turning it on again. This should empty the cache. Then put in a non RCE disc, go 
through 1). to 4). again, eject the disc and try the RCE disc. If this doesn't work 
you can try to overwrite the system memory by playing 10 discs, none of which have 
the same title as the last 10 discs played.

Good Luck; I know the change to region 0 works 'cos I've done it,
