Lifestyle & 321 Extensions Upgrade
---------------------------------------------------------------
This upgrade adds a lot of improvements throughout the system 
focusing on the remote. The most noticeable differences 
has to be:

* The Addition of Pal Progressive, MULTI Progressive, MULTI 
  Component & MULTI Composite+S
* Upgrades system to allow better use with DVR’s 
* New button functions listed below.


---------------------------------------------------------------
Additional controls for the 321 & 321GS and LS 18II, 28II, 35II
---------------------------------------------------------------
Shuffle - Moves back a few seconds in your DVR (or other digital 
          video recorder) if the remote is set up for this 
          control.

Repeat  - Moves ahead a few seconds in your DVR (or other 
          digital video recorder) if the remote is set up for 
          this control.


---------------------------------------------------------------
The LS 38, 48 & 321GSX does all of the above and
---------------------------------------------------------------
+/-  In an on-screen program guide or cable selection list, 
     moves to the previous or next page. This reveals 
     additional content for your TV, cable/satellite box, or 
     VCR/DVR (as applicable), when the remote is set up to 
     control such components.

Using US Record/ABC Function

  Library  - When a video source is selected, changes between a 
             4:3 screen! display ratio and 16:9 widescreen 
             display. This requires a TV that provides that 
             function. Your remote also must be set up to 
             control the TV.

  Encore   - In VCR/Cable-Satelite source (or AUX, if a 
             recorder-type device is connected to that input),

             remotes set to control Teletext.
