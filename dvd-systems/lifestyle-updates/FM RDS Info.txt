6.4 RDS Operation
This feature is only implemented in the European version of the AV28 media center.
The LC72722 Radio Data System (RDS) decoder IC, U102, is a single-chip system IC that implements
the signal processing required by both the European RDS standard and US RDBS system.
RDS/RDBS systems can send digital information over the airwaves along with the standard FM
signal by adding a digitally modulated 57 kHz subcarrier to the normal FM composite signal. The
LC72722 includes a bandpass filter, demodulator, synchronization, and error correction circuits.
The input (pin 2) to the RDS IC comes from Q104, which buffers the FM composite signal at pin 23
of the LA1837. The timebase for the decoder is a crystal oscillator formed by the 4.332 MHz
crystal, Y101, the inverter internal to the IC across pins 12 and 13, and the two shunt capacitors,
C138 and C139. Control of the RDS IC is achieved by using the same CCB bus interface used for
the PLL IC.


AM/FM Tuner differences:
Capacitors C2026 and C2027 and the internal resistance of the LA1837 set the FM deemphasis.
For a US unit the capacitor values are set to produce 75-uSec de-emphasis, and for Europe/Japan they
are set to produce 50-uSec de-emphasis. MPX filters, T2003 and T2004,reject the residual 
19 kHz pilot tone and 38 kHz sub-channel demodulation components.
