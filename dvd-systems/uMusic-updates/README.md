## Step 0
- a MAJOR update to uMusic was made in 2009 by Bose. It is now called uMusic+ and among its many changes it allows you to store MP3 files now.

<b>Information</b>:
* <a href="https://github.com/bosefirmware/cd-updates/raw/master/dvd-systems/uMusic-updates/uMusic%2B.pdf">Information about uMusic+</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/bosefirmware/cd-updates/raw/master/dvd-systems/uMusic-updates/uMusic%2B_guide_engvo.pdf">The new uMusic+ manual</a>

<b>Note</b>: 321GSX & 321GSXL systems will have the Remote Control menu in the System menu removed. So please reference your manual to get correct remote codes.

## Step 1

Download entire contents from _one_ of the linked folders below, for the full file :

- VS2.05.00.18
- old BB.07.08.01
- new BB.02.01.00
- 1802DVD.1B22

## Step 2
- Go to where you downloaded the zip files and make sure they are all in the same folder. 

Extract a larger ".iso" file that you can then place on to a DVD using DVD burner software (note uMusic updates will not fit on a CD so a DVD burner and blank DVD will be required).

<b>Instructions</b>: Use the following link to instruct you on how to burn the ISO to the disc <a href="https://www.petri.com/how_to_write_iso_files_to_cd">How to write (burn) ISO files to a CD</a>

## Step 3
- Record your systems settings
* With your TV turned on, press the <b>TV</b> button on your Bose remote.
* Press the <b>System</b> button and the System menu should appear on the screen (if you do not see the System Menu, Press the TV input button on the remote or use your TV remote to select a different video input)
* Make note of any setting you have changed like "Optical source". LIFESTYLE systems make sure to record your Remote Control settings & if your TV Power is set to automatic.

## Step 4
- Once this is done place the DVD into the 321/Lifestyle system tray. Put it on CD-DVD mode and <b>wait about an hour</b> while it updates the uMusic database. <b>While you do this update you will not be able to use the system</b> (not even the radio), so do this update when you don't want to use it.

## Step 5
- Once it asks you to "Remove Disc" you are finished and the system is updated!

<b>Important</b>: _If the message Error 116 - call Bose appears on the media center display immediately following the update, press Eject on the media center and remove the disc from the Tray. Press Eject again to close the tray._</br>
* _If the message clears, the update is complete (no need to call Bose)_</br>
* _If the message remains, or if another error message appears on the display (please record the error code), call Bose._
