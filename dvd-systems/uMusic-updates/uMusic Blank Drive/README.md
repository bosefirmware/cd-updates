Well recently the hard drive on my uMusic system died. So after getting my system repaired I made a copy of the blank uMusic drive. I have done this so (if you wish) you can go and purchase a blank 40GB laptop hard drive, copy over the data, and replace your broken one with one that works.

## Requirements:
* Get a 40GB laptop hard drive (Bose uses Toshiba, but I doubt that is a requirement)
* Approx 2 gigs of free Hard drive space available
* a Bose uMusic system
* a few hours to download & create the file system

## Step 1 
- <b>Software</b> - Download all files named <b>uMusic Blank Drive.zip.001</b> through <b>uMusic Blank Drive.zip.037</b>

## Step 2 
- Go to where you downloaded the zip file and extract the folder. It containes the files needed.

## Step 3 
- The <a href="http://www.runtime.org/driveimage-xml.htm">DriveImage program</a> (included in the folder and <a href="https://github.com/bosefirmware/cd-updates/raw/master/dvd-systems/uMusic-updates/uMusic%20Blank%20Drive/driveimage%20xml%201.21.exe">here</a>) is free! If you have any questions about DriveImage please see their <a href="http://www.runtime.org/driveimage_faq.htm">FAQ</a>.

    If you're having problems with the partition you will have to find a way to partition the drive.
    * Partition 1 was in Fat32 and was 30,112,006,114 bytes long.
    * Partition 2 registered as unformatted and took up the rest of the drive.

## Step 4 
- Once everything is done <a href="https://github.com/bosefirmware/cd-updates/tree/master/dvd-systems/uMusic-updates">update your uMusic to the latest version</a>.

I have not attempted to create a drive from blank so let me know how this all works out and I will revise the instructions as needed.

Good luck!
